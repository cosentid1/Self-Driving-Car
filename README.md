# Self-Driving Car

This is a custom built vehicle that can travel around an area and detect obstacles using an ultrasonic sensor. If an object is detected, an interrupt will cause the car to stop and back away from it. The car is controlled by an MSP-EXP432E401Y microcontroller and the code is written in C.

## Design Overview
The aim of this project was to develop a more fundamental understanding of sensors and how they interact with both a microcontroller and the envrionment. It was also an attempt to create a device that is constantly moving and interacting with its envrionment in real-time.

This vehicle is powered by an MSP-EXP432E401Y microcontroller that communicates with an ultrasonic sensor through interrupts. The controller will send out a signal to activate the sensor. At this point, an internal timer module on the processor is started. The sensor will send out a signal and once it returns, will tell the processor to stop the timer through an interrupt. Based on the processors internal clock cycle, which is 120Mhz, the time recorded by the module and the speed of sound, the distance of the nearest obstacle is calcualted. If this value is less than 35, then the car will stop and drive backwards for about 8 full rotations of the stepper motor. The body of the car was made using K'nex and was designed to evenly distribute the amount of increased friction that putting the processor and the battery pack on top would cause.

## Design Process
To build this car, first the frame and the drving mechanics were made. The entire frame of the car was made using K'nex as this was the easiest way to attach a piece to the rotating part of the stepper motor. The motors were not very strong on their own so a gear system was used to increase the torque generated by the motor. Once this was working, the frame was extended and the system was tested to make sure it would actually move when left on its own.

Once this was working, the next step was to build the front wheels and make them able to turn. This took a lot of time to get the weight distribution right so the front wheels would turn smoothly. Song the motor was right on top of the wheels, there was a lot of down force and would cause the wheels to not move while the motor tried to rotate, but after bit of time the system had built enough force to snap the wheels all the way to the other side, which was not what was desired. This made it hard to perform controlled turns as a lot of correction was needed to navigate around. Eventually this snapping was fixed but a new problem had arisen. The car simply would not move forward, or if it did, it would not move very far comapred to before the wheels were added. After lots of stuggling, the only way to have the car move forward was to remove the motor that controlled the turning along with many other pieces. This was a very disheartening moment since the car nearly worked with all of the parts on but it was just a little bit too heavy and since K'nex parts are very light, removing them would not affect the total car weight very much.

All of the part that had to be removed from the car in order for it to be light enough to move forward with the processor and battery pack on top.

## Next Steps
As seen in the design process, the car was originally supposed to turn to avoid obstacles but the motor at the front made it too heavy and the car would not move. To be able to reimplement the turning mechanism, a stronger motor would have to be used at the back, or a more complex gear system to increase torque could also be a solution to this problem. Another improvement could be to add sensors to the side and back of the car. Currently the car only avoids obstacles by backing away from them. With more sensors, the car could try turning to the left or right based on data collected so it can navigate around any room on its own.
