# Self-Driving Car

This is a custom built vehicle that can travel around an area and detect obstacles using an ultrasonic sensor. If an object is detected, an interrupt will cause the car to stop and back away from it. The car is controlled by an MSP-EXP432E401Y microcontroller and the code is written in C.
